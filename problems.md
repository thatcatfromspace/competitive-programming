first few problems are random, then questions are covered topicwise from [striver's dsa course](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2), starting from [here](https://github.com/thatcatfromspace/competitive-programming/blob/main/problems.md#majority-element---leetcode).

## Binary addition - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string addBinary(string a, string b) {
      int i = a.size() - 1;
        int j = b.size() - 1;
        int carry = 0;
        string res = "";
        while (i >= 0 || j >= 0) {
            int sum = carry;

            if (i >= 0) {
                sum += a[i] - '0';
                i--;
            }
            if (j >= 0) {
                sum += b[j] - '0';
                j--;
            }

            carry = sum > 1 ? 1 : 0;
            res += to_string(sum % 2);
        }
        if (carry) 
            res += to_string(carry);
        reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
        return res;
    }
};
```

Explanation [here](https://aaronice.gitbook.io/lintcode/string/add-binary)

1. initialize variables `i` and `j` as indices pointing to the least significant digits of `a` and `b` respectively, and `carry` as 0.
2. initialize an empty string `res` to store the result.
3. iterate through the strings `a` and `b` from right to left:
    - add the current digits of `a` and `b` along with the carry.
    - update carry as necessary.
    - append the sum modulo 2 to the result string.
4. if there is a carry after iterating through both strings, append it to the result string.
5. reverse the result string to get the correct binary representation of the sum.
6. return the result string.

## Length of last word - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/)

initial thoughts:

- must keep track of penultimate and last space 

simplest approach with Python:

```python
def last_word(word):
	return len(word.strip().split(' ')[-1])
```

For C++, use the `stringstream` to constantly fetch the next word and calculate its size.


## Climbing stairs - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs)

initial thoughts:

- classic DP problem, requires memoization of some kind.
- turns out to be basic Fibonacci series 

Detailed explanation [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/solutions/3708750/4-method-s-beat-s-100-c-java-python-beginner-friendly/)

## Highest altitude - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude)

apply the concept of [prefix sum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prefix-sum-array-implementation-applications-competitive-programming/) to find the maximum altitude.

tip: `*max_element(vector.begin(), vector.end());` returns the maximum number in a vector - returns an iterator hence the pointer.

tip 2: if it is not explicitly stated that you cannot modify the given array/vector, play around with it to save memory usage.


## Pivot index - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-pivot-index)

find sum of all elements, then start comparing left sum and right sum from the end.

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-pivot-index/solutions/5173369/easy-c-solution/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)


## First occurrence of a string - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string)

Thought about implementing a two pointer approach, but got stuck with non-existent cases and repeated letters.

Instead, **go with finding substrings sequentially**. from `i = 0 to biggerWord.size()`.


## Majority element - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element)

easy. sort the array, the middle element should be your answer.

alternatively, reduce time complexity to `O(n)` by using a hashmap.

## Sort colors - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors)

did not know how to proceed. tried to naively sort the array in place resulting in around `O(n)` complexity.

instead, use a hashmap to map the number of 0s, 1s and 2s, clear the array, and then push them back in the right order with the count from the hashmap.

## Lucky numbers in matrix - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/lucky-numbers-in-a-matrix)

find min element in row, push it to an array, find max element in row, push it to another array. 
from both arrays, match elements from both arrays in the original matrix to find lucky numbers.

## Remove duplicate from sorted array - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

two pointer approach. maintain a pointer `i` from the beginning and a right pointer `ptr = 1`, move ptr when `nums[i] != nums[ptr-1]`, and return `ptr` as we need to return the number of unique elements in the array, which is just equal to `ptr`.

## Rotate array - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)

naive approach is to mod the index of every element plus `k` and place them into a new array, i.e., `newArray[(i+k) % size] = nums[i]`, and the copy them back into `nums` so it gives **the illusion** of it being an in-place algorithm.

better approach is applying reverse operation 3 times, first on the entire array, then from the beginning to the`k`th element, and then from the `k`th element to the end.

## Find missing element in range - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

lakshman is brilliant. find the sum of numbers from range `[0, nums.size()]` and then subtract it from actual sum of the given array (psst, `std::accumulate()`) and the difference is the missing numbers. absolutely genius.

## Maximum consecutive ones - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)

my approach was a bit convoluted. set `lastZero = -1` and then start looking for zeroes in the array. on the first encounter, set `highest = i` (index of the first 0) and `lastZero` to the same as well. compare subsequent differences and if the last element is 1, make sure to check if the highest condition still satisfies. 

note: edge case optimization (`nums.size() <= 1`) helped me get slightly better time.

edit: **better approach**

maintain two variables `currSum` and `prevSum` both set to 0 initially. whenever a `1` is encountered, increment `currSum`, otherwise, set `prevSum` to `max(currentSum, prevSum)` and return the maximum of both.

## Single number - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

XOR! xor all elements in the array with `ans = 0`, the resulting `ans` is the missing number. ðŸ¤¯

note: bitwise operations always yield an INTEGER, not a BOOLEAN.

## Maximum subarray aka Kadane's algorithm - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

Use two variables `max_ending_here = INT_MIN` and `max_so_far = 0`, in a `for` loop on all the elements in the given array, increment `max_ending_here` by the current element, and then compare `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far`, if the former is larger, set `max_so_far` to `max_ending_here`, then, if `max_ending_here < 0`, set it to 0. return `max_starting_here`.

associated g4g article [here](https://geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/).

## Best time to buy and sell stock - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

classic sliding window problem, can also be related to Kadane's algo (how?). create two variables `lowest = prices[0]` and `ans = INT_MIN`, iterate over each element `price` to see if the next price is smaller and then set `ans` to `max(ans, price - lowest)`.

## Sort the people - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people)

one of the most easiest, most straightforward questions i've seen. throw the heights mapped to the names into an `unordered_map` and then sort, reverse and throw the names back into another new array in the sorted order and return the array.

## Rotate list - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)

same as rotate array but with a linked list. the mod approach did not work (too many edge case violations), instead manually cut off the list at `count - k -1` and reattach this to the beginning of the linked list. 

very intuitive solution (by me) [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/submissions/1330229947/)

## Reverse linked list - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list)

use a stack to store the elements and then store it in the linked list backwards.

## Search insert position - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position)

binary search your way to find the given element in the array, and then return low (this is equivalent to finding floor) for it to be the position where the number should be inserted.

## Two sum - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum)

simplest one pass algorithm is to create a hashmap of the numbers in their array and their index. as the `for` loop iterates, return the number and its complement if it exists or store the number in the array. 

## Reverse words in a string - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string)

shamelessly use python. genius one liner crafted by me.

```py
 def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        return ' '.join(s.strip().split()[::-1])
```

## Check if LL is a palindrome - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list)

add the elements of the LL to an array `arr`, compare if `arr[i]` equals `arr[size-i-1]` for `i = 0 to size/2`.  

optimal approach: `O(1)` space: traverse half the linked list using fast/slow pointers then reverse the list. traverse the other half of the old LL and the reverse new LL (which is nothing but the first half of the LL) to check if the value of each node is equal.

## Valid anagram - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram)

approach 1: `O(n*logn)` - separate the array into characters, push it into 2 arrays, sort the arrays and compare
approach 2: `O(n)` - add the elements of first string to a hashmap, and compare the hash values of second string to first; if `hashmap[letter] == 0`, then return false. [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/submissions/1340520551/)


## Rotate string - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-string)

iterate through the string adding the first letter of the string to the end each time, and compare the resultant **substring** to `goal`.

## Add two numbers - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

straightforward approach, for every element, `sum = (l1->val + l2->val + carry) % 10` and `carry = ((l1->val + l2->val + carry) / 10`. be sure to add extra carry to the end after you're done adding.

## Minimum pushes II - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-pushes-to-type-word-ii/)

for the longest time i kept thinking that the letter corresponding to the count matters. it doesn't.
add the count of each letter to an array, sort the array, and then itertate over each element of the array.

```cpp
totalPresses += (i / 8 + 1) * count[i]
```

## Kth distinct string in array - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-distinct-string-in-an-array/)

map every string to an array. if mapped value of string equals 1, it is distinct. then iterate over every string in the array, and for every unique encountered, reduce `k` by 1. if `k == 0`, return that string.

quite elegant submission [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-distinct-string-in-an-array/submissions/1348559365).

## Minimum bit flips required - [LeetCode]()

XOR the given numbers to find the number of differing digits. then increment count everytime a `1` is encountered (by `num & 1`) and right shift the pointer num.

## Linked list cycle - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle)

classic tortoise and hare pointer problem. while `fast && fast->next`, iterate until both pointers are equal, return true if yes, else there is no cycle in the list.

## Largest odd number in string - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-odd-number-in-string)

the point is to start counting from the **end**, not the start. if the current digit is even, change the return string to a substring of the original string from `0` to `i+1`.

## Count and say - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say)

immediately arrived at the logic to find the run length encoding of the given string, however, was stuck with handling the last character of the string. to handle that, the solution is embarrassingly simple. just add a whitespace to the end of the string.

my solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/submissions/1351865671/)

## Assign cookies - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies)

sort both the size and greed arrays. maintain a pointer for each array `sp` and `gp` and incrmement both if `s[sp] >= g[gp]`, else just increment the size pointer.

## Power of two - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two)

find `n & (n - 1)`. powers of two are of the form `1000...` and one less that `n` will always be of the form `0111...`, hence the result is always `0` if `n` is a power of 2. 

## Swap two numbers - [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/swap-two-numbers3844/1)

there is a very simple trick to swap two numbers without using any extra memory.

```cpp
a = a ^ b;
b = a ^ b;
a = a ^ b;
```

it is guaranteed that `a` and `b` are swapped. 

for more bit manipulation techniques, see [here](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/1073221/All-about-Bitwise-Operations-Beginner-Intermediate)

## Subsets - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets)

since i already knew that a bit manipulation approach has to be taken, i immediately found that for an array of size `k`, numbers from 0 to `2^k` can be used to mask indices of the actual array. however, the implementation was BAD, optimal approach [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/solutions/5186398/faster-less-mem-3-methods-detailed-approach-recursion-bit-mani-iterative-python-java-c/)

## Lemonade stand - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change)

greedy approach is the answer. solved the problem initially without realizing that the number of $5 and $10 dollar notes need to be kept in count, so used a bunch of if-else conditions to keep that in track as well. for each transaction, manually check the number of both bills present and then provide change accordingly.

## Flood fill - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill)

dfs or bfs can be used here. we take the `delCol` and `delRow` approach to calculate the 4-directional neighbors of the current matrix cell. very similar to the [rotten oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotten-oranges) problem.

## Ransom note - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note)

take an `unoreder_map` approach. for every letter in `magazine`, map it and subtract every occurence of the letter from the map when iterating through `ransomNote`. if any letter does not exist, i.e., `map[letter] < 1`, return false. felt it was very similar to [minimum presses for word](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-pushes-to-type-word-ii/)

## Number of 1 bits - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits)

genius bit manipulation. for `i` in range 31 - 0, successively right shift the given number by `i` places and perform `&` with `1`. on each shift, we can determine if the last bit after the shift is `1`, thereby incrementing count everytime that `((n >> i) & 1 == 1` succeeds.

## Roman to integer - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer)

the trick is to iterate from behind the string. if the `i - 1`th bit is lesser than the `i`th bit, for example `IV`, add the resultant of their difference to the resultant integer or just add it to the integer.

## Number of islands - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands)

for every cell in the matrix, perform bfs/dfs on the matrix if the current cell is `1`. if the current cell has not been visitted (vistted row, columns are kept in track using an `unordered_set`) and for each unvisitted `1`, an island is added.

key takeaway is the difference between usage of `unoreder_map` and `unordered_set`. 

## Same tree - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree)

immediately knew it was a recursive dfs solution. but had problems defining the true/false conditions. the key is to return the logical AND: `isSameTree(p->left, q->left) && isSameTree(p->right, q->right)` as the final answer.

## Maximum points you can obtain from cards - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-points-you-can-obtain-from-cards)

the approach is a two pointer sliding window that calculates the maximum sum by removing one element from the start and adding an element from the end. genius stuff.

![a539e5d3-3faa-43d3-bfcd-8a6549e4589b_1656213784 1710274](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e24ee2d1-e42c-4374-81f9-bd7e37804c07)

## Product of array except self - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self)

approach is to maintian a prefix and suffix product array such that `pre[i] = pre[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]` (note: product is NOT with `nums[i]`, we need everything except self) and suffix product similarly but with one element forward. then `nums[i]` simply becomes `pre[i] * suf[i]`.

## Longest consecutive sequence - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence)

throw all the numbers in the array into an `unordered_set` and for each element `num` in the set, if `num - 1` is not found (i.e., `num` is the start of a sequence) in the set, increment `count` until the next consecutive element is not found. maintain a global count `largest` and at the end of each sequence end, assign `max(count, largest)` to `largest`.  

## Odd event linked list - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list)

keep joining odd and even nodes together, and at the end, join the even node linked list to the back of odd linked list. embarassing that i couldn't figure this out.

## Set matrix zeroes - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)

first solution i could think of was using 2 unordered sets to keep track of set rows and columns, which was indeed the second closest optimal approach, the most optimal approach is to use a flag to keep track of set rows and columns. 

## Pascal triangle - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle)

modified DP approach where the current internal element is the sum of the both the corresponding element and its predecessor in the previous array (i.e., the row on top). we create a dummy row for each iteration with a `0` in the beginning and end to make addition easier without causing an out of bounds indexing error.

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/submissions/1441021937/).

## Letter combinations of a phone number - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number)

the trick is to use backtracking to explore all possible combinations. we do not need to actually "backtrack" for any condition because we won't be reversing any previous moves, but is still a backtracking approach as we call the function for every letter to be added to the combination.

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/submissions/1456973495/)

## Kth smallest element of BST - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

my intial thought was to use a monotonic stack like we always do for k-th smallest/largest element. but the approach is a simpler, modified inorder traversal where we set a counter counting to the value of `k` at every recursive call. 

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/submissions/1457128238/)

## Longest sequence without repeating characters - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)

tried implementing a pure sliding window solution but it did not account for when the repeating character was last seen. solved this issue using a hashmap to record the last known occurence of a character.

## Daily temperatues - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures)

montonic (decreasing) stack approach. an intriguing observation in this question is that it is the index that is stored in the stack, and not the actually temperature value for the day.

## Find common characters - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters)

the approach is not a hashmap. each occurence including duplicates needs to be accounted for, which requires a frequency array. 

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters/submissions/1458980085/)

## Unique paths II - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii)

dp approach. `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]` for all `i > 0` and `j > 0`.

## Trie implementation - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree)

the approach is to build a `TrieNode` with 26 children of the same node, and a boolean to mark the end of the word. we don't actually store words/letters in each node, just the index of the succeeding node at a letter's index if it exists.

## Word break - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break)

assumed it was a trie implementation, but recommended approach is dp (it's always dp). create a boolean array of size `s + 1` and repeatedly check if a valid substring can be made from the starting index to the length of a word. best we can do is `O(mnw)`.

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/submissions/1459371402/)

## Find words II - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii)

the implementation is a trie + DFS on the given grid. create an own trie implementation and then search for the word in the given matrix.

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/submissions/1459704320/)

## Maximum nesting depth of parenthesis - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-the-parentheses)

`current depth = number of ( to left - number of ) to left`. works because it is guaranteed that all test cases are VPS (valid parenthesis strings).

## Pacific Atlantic water flow - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow)

there are two tricks to simplify the problem:

- start from the edges and try to move towards the higher heights instead of starting from the middle and moving to the edges
- maintain separate visitted matrices for atlantic and pacific, then find the intersection 

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/submissions/1460532830/)

## H-index - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)

iterate through the sorted array of citations, return `size - i` if `citations[i] >= size - i` for some `i`, else return `0`.

## Coin change - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change)

classic 1D DP problem. the memoizaiton array is initialized as `vector<int> minCoins(amount + 1, amount + 1)` and stores the minimum number of coins required for each amount less than the actual, given amount. then, for every valid entry such that `i - coins[j] >= 0`, adjust the value of `minCoins[i]` by taking the minimum.

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/submissions/1464002071/)

## Unique paths - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths)

2D matrix traversal problem. `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] for all i, j > 0`.

## Permutations in a string - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string)

sliding window approach. add all the charaters with their frequencies to a hashmap start matching the pattern in the given string with a window size of 1, and keep increasing window size until the matches occur. if not, increment both left and right pointers of the window and continue matchinf.

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/submissions/1464074822/)

## Top K frequent elements - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements)

catch the frequency of each number in a hashmap, then insert all the pairs into a priority queue, pop the top K elements.

NOTE: to write a custom comparator for the priority queue, create a struct/class with and overload the `()` operator for cusotm compare.

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/submissions/1464126763/)

## Most beautiful item for each query - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-beautiful-item-for-each-query)

the idea is to sort the items array first and then binary search for the maximum beauty. there was one thing that i overlooked - preprocessing the given array to assign items the maximum beauty so far for the given price.

NOTE: sorting a `vector<vector<int>>` sorts the member arrays lexicographically.

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-beautiful-item-for-each-query/submissions/1464812465)

## Kth largest element in array - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array)

straightforward max heap question if not for checks for repetition. so what we do instead is create a min heap (counter-intuitive?) and insert elements, and when the size of the heap exceeds `k`, we pop the smallest element after inserting the current element. this way, we finally end up with a heap that contains the `k` max elements.

## Course schedule - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule)

easy. return true if a topological sort can be performed on the given courses. another approach is to find if the graph has cycles (Kahn's algorithm), but finding if a topo sort exists is good enough because every directed acyclic graph has a topological sorting.

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/submissions/1465741933/)

## Optimal partition of string - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-partition-of-string)

easy. used a bitmask to keep track of characters that have already occured and increment the count when a character has already been recorded occurs, and then reset the mask to 0.

solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-partition-of-string/submissions/1467459848)

## Group anagrams - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams)

sort each string and use the sorted string as the key to store the original strings in hashmap. retrieve each element from the hashmap and append to return array.

## Minimum path sum - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum)

don't use a dp table, use the actual grid to calculate the minimum path sum using `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

## Make string using cyclic increments - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-string-a-subsequence-using-cyclic-increments)

two pointer approach. increment pointers based on equality or cyclic increment `(str2[p2] - str1[p1] + 26) % 26 <= 1`. 

## Find the difference - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference)

easy problem, but instead of using a hashmap/hashset, just find the difference of the sum of ASCII values of both strings.

# Binary search trees

try to perform all operations recursively. not as efficient as iterative but atleast your code looks elegant. 

search condition: `while(root)` or `while(root != NULL)` [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/submissions/1419777596/)

insertion: `if (root->val < val) insert(root->right, val) else insert(root->left, val);` [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-binary-search-tree/submissions/1419789254/)

deletion: delete if leaf node, if single child copy its value to parent and delete; if both children exist, find the next successor (left max or right min) and replace with the node value. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/submissions/1419804046/)

## Validate binary search tree - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree) 

my recusrive approach was logically sound to the point where it could validate every subtree - but if a node that should on the adjacent subtree is wrong present, it still validated it.

in the above tree, `3` is not where it should be, but my solution did not accommodate for that. [my half working solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/submissions/1419814765/) 

the key is to create a helper function that handles the minimum and maximum value a child can have, compared to its parent. this way, cross placements are also avoided. [optimal solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/submissions/1419818655/)

## Maximum depth of binary tree - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree)

ez recursive solution. `return max(1 + maxDepth(root->left), 1 + maxDepth(root->right));`

## Level order traversal - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal)

we use a queue to obtain the level order traversal of a BST. the root node is added to the front and from there, elements are subsequently added to the queue and the level order is obtained (until the queue becomes empty, which means that the traversal is complete).

## Binary tree right side view - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view)

the approach is to use level order traversal and save the last node (i.e, the rightmost node) to the array. this way we can achieve the level order traversal view of the level from the top to bottom.

## Counting number of nodes 

```cpp
if (!root) return 0;
return 1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);
```

## Lowest common ancestor - [LeetCode]()


recursively move left/right until there is a need to diverge. this is the lowest common ancestor.
